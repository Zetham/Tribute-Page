                <ul id="tribute-info">
                    <li><span class="bold">Solid Structure: </span>The setup typically involves placing pawns on d4 and e3, and fianchettoing the king's bishop to g3, creating a solid pawn structure that controls the center and provides good defensive capabilities.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Fianchettoed Bishop: </span>The bishop on f4 (or g3, after fianchettoing) exerts influence along the long diagonal, putting pressure on Black's pawn structure and potentially supporting future pawn breaks or piece maneuvers.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Flexible Development: </span>The London System allows for flexible development of the pieces, often leading to a variety of setups depending on Black's responses. This adaptability is one reason why players of various skill levels and styles find it appealing.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Popular at All Levels: </span>The London System is commonly played at all levels of chess, from beginner to grandmaster. Its straightforward ideas and solid structure make it a favorite among club players and even some top-level professionals.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Less Theory-Heavy: </span>Compared to some other mainline openings, the London System tends to involve less theory. While there are still many nuances and subtleties to master, players often find it easier to grasp the fundamental ideas and plans.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Transpositional Potential: </span>The London System can often transpose into other openings or systems, offering White the opportunity to switch between different pawn structures and setups based on Black's responses.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Strategic Themes: </span>Typical strategic themes in the London System include controlling the center, restraining Black's pawn breaks, preparing pawn advances on the kingside or queenside, and creating imbalances to exploit in the middlegame.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Counterplay for Black: </span>Despite its solid reputation, the London System does allow for counterplay by Black. Common strategies for Black include challenging White's central control, aiming for piece activity, and potentially exploiting the light squares left behind by White's pawn structure.
